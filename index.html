					<h1>Building the Legacy</h1>
					<h2>Founded in 2011, the team has designed, manufactured, and competed annually at Baja SAE competitions across the continent. 
						At the end of each academic year, our team competes internationally in the Baja SAE collegiate design series. Organized by 
						the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and taking place in the United States, these intercollegiate competitions take 
						place over four days. There are an array of events to be judged in; scores are based on the teamâ€™s engineering design, 
						business presentation and vehicle performance on the track over punishing terrain.</h2>
